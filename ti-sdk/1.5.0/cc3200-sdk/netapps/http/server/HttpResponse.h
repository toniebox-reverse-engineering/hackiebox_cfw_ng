/**
 * @defgroup HttpResponse HTTP and WebSocket Response modules
 * This module implements routines to allow content handler modules to build and send HTTP responses back to the client.
 * There are two layers in this module:
 * - The lower layer consists of HttpResponse_Headers() and HttpResponse_Content(). These routines allow the caller to specify all details of the response.
 * - The higher layer consists of HttpResponse_Canned*(). These routines emit canned (pre-made) responses, such as redirects and errors, which are useful in many situations.
