 * @defgroup HttpAuth HTTP Authentication
 * This module implements the HTTP digest access authentication routines.
 * Note this module is only compiled if HTTP_CORE_ENABLE_AUTH is defined in HttpConfig.h
 * 
 * When a "not authorized" response is sent to the client, the WWW-Authenticate header is built using HttpAuth_ResponseAuthenticate()
 * This in turn generates new nonce and opaque values which will be used for authentication.
 * Note that since only a single nonce is kept, only one client may ever be authenticated simultaneously.
 * When another request with Authorization header is received, it is verified using HttpAuth_RequestAuthenticate()
 * If all authentication tests pass, then the appropriate flag is set in the request to indicate that.
 *

 * This function may then be called at any time during the operation of the server in order to set different user credentials

 * Builds and returns the WWW-Authenticate response header.
 * This implies generating a new nonce, etc.
 * Notes about return value:
 *     Upon entry, pWWWAuthenticate should point to the place in the packet-send buffer where the header needs to be generated, and also specify the maximum amount of bytes available for the header at that place
 *     Upon return, pWWWAuthenticate points to the same location, but specifies the actual length of the header.
 *     If the returned length is 0, this means that there was not enough room in the buffer for the header.
 *     In such a case, the core may try again with a larger buffer
 * @param pRequest All data about the request
 * @param[in,out] pWWWAuthenticate On entry specifies the memory location to build the header at, and the maximum size. On return, specifies the same location and the actual size of the header line
