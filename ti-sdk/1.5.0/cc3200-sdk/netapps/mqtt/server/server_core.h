/**@file server_core.h
   The MQTT server daemon, a task, provisions the high level abstractions for the
   smart applicaltions. This is an intelligent layer that utilizes the services
   of the MQTT Server Packet Library and is responsible for the functions of the
   topic management, the client management and support of multiple server
   applications.

   The light-weight server enables the services of the MQTT protocol for an
   application to either extend and / or control the existing functions to suit
   the deployment specific scenario. These applications in practice are the
   plug-ins / add-ons to the core server functionalities. Specifically,
   these applications, among others capabilities, can be used for analyzing and
   approving the credentials of the remote clients, acting as a bridge between
   a MQTT external client and the server, and a snooper to learn about all the
   data transactions to / from the server.

   The server is targeted to conform to MQTT 3.1.1 specification.

   The services of the server are multi-task safe. Platform specific atomicity
   constructs are used, through abstractions, by the server to maintain data
   coherency and synchronization.

   The server offers the following compile line configurable parameters (-D opt)
   - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_MQP_TX_LEN: </b> the constant buffer length allocated for a TX.
   \n\n
   - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_SUBTOP_LEN: </b> the maximum buffer size to hold a sub-topic.
   For e.g., in the topic /x/y/z, the phrase /x, /y and z are sub-topics.
   \n\n
   - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_TOPIC_NODE: </b> the maximum number of topic nodes in server.
   For e.g., in the topic /x/y/z, there are three nodes (/x, /y and z).
   \n\n
   - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_CL_ID_SIZE: </b> the maximum length of the client-id string.
   \n\n
   - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_NUM_CLIENT: </b> the maximum number of clients to be managed.
   Note this is different from the maximum number of 'contexts'. A large number
   of clients can be managed using fewer number of 'contexts' (connections).
   \n\n

   @note Any future extensions & development must follow the following guidelines.
   A new API or an extension to the existing API
   a) must be rudimentary
   b) must not imply a rule or policy (including a state machine)
   b) must ensure simple design and implementation
