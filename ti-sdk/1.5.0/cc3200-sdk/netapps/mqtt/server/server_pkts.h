/**@file server_pkts.h
   The C library provisions the interface / API(s) for the MQTT Server Packet LIB.

   This is a light-weight library that enables the services of the MQTT protcol
   for user's server application(s) to exchange the MQTT packets with one or
   more remote clients. The Server Packet LIB is a simple and easy-to-use
   implementation to support both un-packing of the messages received from the
   remote clients and formation of packets to be sent to the remote clients. 

   The library is targeted to conform to MQTT 3.1.1 specification.

   The Server Packet LIB is a highly portable software and implies a very limited
   set of dependencies on a platform. Importantly, these limited dependencies are
   common features used in the embedded and the networking world, and can be
   easily adapted to the target platforms. The services of the library are
   multi-task safe. Platform specific atomicity constructs are used, through
   abstractions, by the library to maintain data coherency and synchronization.
   In addition, the library can be configured to support several in-flight
   messages.

   The Server Packet LIB can support multiple and simultaneous MQTT connections
   from clients. However, the responsibility of managing the clients and topics,
   authentication and approval for connections and supporting any other needs
   that specific to the deployment remains with the user application.

   The number of the network connections that the Server Packet LIB can support
   is configurable through the compile line option / flag <b> -DCFG_SR_MQTT_CTXS
   </b>. In addition, the maximum length of the RX buffer used by the server is
   also configurable through the compile line option / flag <b>
   -DCFG_SR_MAX_MQP_RX_LEN </b>.

   @note Any future extensions & development must follow the following guidelines.
   A new API or an extension to the existing API
   a) must be rudimentary
   b) must not imply a rule or policy (including a state machine)
   b) must ensure simple design and implementation
