/**@file mqtt_client.h
   This C library provisions the interface / API(s) for the MQTT Client.

   This is a light-weight library to enable the services of the MQTT protocol
   for one or more client applications (that would typically run on a resource
   constrained system). The key consideration in the design of small footprint
   library has been the abstraction of the low level details of the message
   transactions with the server and yet, provide rudimentary API(s), such that,
   the capabilities and features of the protocol are availalbe to be utilized
   by existing and new applications in an un-restrictive manner.

   The library is targeted to conform to MQTT 3.1.1 specification.

   The MQTT Client library is a highly portable software and implies a very
   limited set of dependencies on a platform. Importantly, these limited
   dependencies are the commonly used features used in the embedded and the
   networking world, and can be easily adapted to the target platforms.

   The services of the library are multi-task safe. Platform specific atomicity
   constructs are used, through abstractions, by the library to maintain data 
   coherency and synchronization. In addition, the library can be configured to
   support several in-flight messages.

   The client library supports multiple and simultaneous MQTT connections to one
   or more servers. In this client LIB, the reference to an individual connection
   in conjunction with the associated configuration parameters has been termed as
   a 'context'. Therefore, the client library supports multiple 'contexts'. An
   application that intends to make use of the client library must set-up or
   create a 'context' prior to establishing a connection with the server. The
   application can choose to destroy the 'context' after the connection with the
   server has been terminated. The client LIB can only support a finite set of
   'contexts' and the number can be configured by using a compiler line option /
   flag <b> -DCFG_CL_MQTT_CTXS </b>.

   Once, the 'context' is set-up, the application can send and receive the MQTT
   packets to / from the server. Among several features supported by the client
   LIB, the 'context' manages the keep-alive mechanism by automatically sending
   PING request to the server, if there has been no other packet send to the
   server with the keep-alive duration. 
   
   @note Any future extensions & development must follow the following guidelines.
   A new API or an extension to the existing API
   a) must be rudimentary
   b) must not imply a rule or policy (including a state machine)
   b) must ensure simple design and implementation

    with the server.

    A meaningful size of the pool is very much application specific and depends
    on the target functionality. For example, an application that intends to have
    only one in-flight message to the server would need atmost three MQP buffers
    (1 for TX (for Qos1 or 2 store), 1 for RX and 1 for CONNECT message). If the
    application sends only QoS0 messages to the server, then the number of MQP
    buffers would reduce to two (i.e. 1 Tx to support CONNECT / PUB out and 1 RX)

/** Create a Network Connection Context.
    This routine sets-up the parameters that are required to operate and manage
    the network connection with a MQTT server / broker. As part of the creation
    of a context, the implementation also records the handle, if provided, by
    the application. In addition, the invoker of the routine must facilitate a
    place holder to enable the client LIB to provision the reference to the 
    'context', so created.

    Specifically, this routine associates or ties-up, in an one-to-one manner,
    the caller provided handle 'app' and the client LIB provisioned handle 'ctx'.
    The parameter 'app' is returned by the client LIB in certain other routines
    to indicate the underlying 'context' with which network transaction or event
    is associated. Similarly, the caller must specify the context handle 'ctx'
    for which the services are being invoked.

    A user or a task prior to utilizing the services of the library to schedule
    MQTT transactions must create a 'context'. A client LIB 'context' can be
    operated in two modes: (a) sync-wait or explicit receive mode and (b) the
    callback mode. Provisioning or absence of the callback parameter in this
    routine defines the mode of operation of the 'context'.

    Explicit receive mode is analogous to the paradigm of the socket programming
    in which an application utilize the recv() function call. It is anticipated
    that applications which would make use of limited set of MQTT messages may
    find this mode of operation useful. Applications which intend to operate the
    'context' in this mode must not provision any callbacks.

    On the other hand, certain applications, may prefer an asynchronous mode of
    operation and would want the client LIB 'context' to raise callbacks into
    the application, as and when, packets arrive from the server. And such
    applications must provide the callback routines.

    @param[in] ctx_cfg configuration information for the Network Context. 
    @param[in] ctx_cbs callback routines. Must be set to NULL, if the application
    intends to operate the context in the sync-wait / explicit receive mode.
