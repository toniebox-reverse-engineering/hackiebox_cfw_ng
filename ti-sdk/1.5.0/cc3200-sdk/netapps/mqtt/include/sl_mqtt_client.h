          * \section intro_sec Introduction
          The SimpleLink MQTT Client Layer provides an easy-to-use API(s) to enable
          constrained and deeply embedded microcontroller based products to interact
          with cloud or network based server for telemetery. The users of SL MQTT
          Client services, while benefiting from the abstraction of the MQTT protocol
          would find them suitable for varied deployments of MQTT subscribers and / or
          publishers.

          The following figure outlines the composition of the SL MQTT Client Layer
		  * \image html ./sl_mqtt_client_view.png
          
          * \section descrypt_sec Description
          The SL MQTT Client Layer, in addition to providing services to the application,
          encompasses a RTOS task to handle the incoming messages from the server. Such
          a dedicated context to process the messages from the server facilitates the
          apps to receive data (i.e. PUBLISH messages) even when they are blocked, whilst
          awaiting ACK for a previous transaction with the server. The receive task in
          the SL MQTT Layer can not be disabled anytime, however its system wide priority
          is configurable and can be set.

          Some of the salient features of the SL MQTT Layer are 
          
          - Easy-to-use, intuitive and small set of MQTT API
          - App can indicate its choice to await ACK for a message transaction
          - Supports MQTT 3.1 protocol

          * \section config_sec Configuration
          The SL implementation enables the application developers to configure the
          following parameters using the compile line flags (-D option)
          * - <b> CFG_SL_CL_MAX_MQP: </b> the count of TX + RX resources in the buffer pool
	  for the library to use. \n\n
          * - <b> CFG_SL_CL_BUF_LEN: </b> the length of the TX and RX buffers in the pool. \n\n
          * - <b> CFG_SL_CL_STACK: </b> Max stack (bytes) for RX Task executed by SL-MQTT. \n\n
          * - <b> CFG_CL_MQTT_CTXS: </b> the max number of simultaneous network connections
          to one or more servers. \n\n

          * \section seq_sec Sequence Diagram
          The following sequence diagram outlines one of the possible usecases
	  (Blocking APIs with QOS1) using the SL MQTT Client Layer
          * \image html ./sl_mqtt_client_seq.jpg

          * \note An app that has chosen not to await an ACK from the server for an
          scheduled transaction can benefit from the availability of control to
          pursue other activities to make overall progress in the system. However,
          an attempt to schedule another transaction with the server, while the
          previous one is still active, will depend on the availability of buffers for transaction.
