          \section intro_sec Introduction

          The SimpleLink MQTT Server Layer provides an easy-to-use API(s) to enable
          constrained and deeply embedded microcontroller based products to interact
          with cloud or network based clients for telemetry. The users of SL MQTT
          server services, while benefiting from the abstraction of the MQTT protocol
          would find them suitable for development of MQTT Servers.

                   
          \section descrypt_sec Description

          The SL MQTT Server Layer, in addition to providing services to the server
          application, encompasses an RTOS task to handle the incoming messages from the
          various clients conencted to the server.
          Such a dedicated context to process the messages from the clients facilitates the
          app to receive data (for ex. PUBLISH messages) even when it is 
          transacting with another client. This is important considering that a server 
          application has to manage messages from multiple clients connected
          to it simulatneously.
          The receive task in the SL MQTT Server Layer can not be disabled anytime, 
          however its system wide priority is configurable and can be set.

          Some of the salient features of the SL MQTT Layer are 
          
          - Easy-to-use, intuitive and small set of MQTT API
          - App can indicate its choice to await ACK for a message transaction

          \section config_sec Configurations
          The SL implementation enables the application developers to configure the
	  following parameters using the compile line flags (-D option):
          - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_MQP_RX_LEN</b> max length of the RX buffer for the server.
          - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_MQP_TX_LEN: </b> the constant buffer length allocated for a TX.\n\n
          - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_SUBTOP_LEN: </b> the maximum buffer size to hold a sub-topic.
          For e.g., in the topic /x/y/z, the phrase /x, /y and z are sub-topics. \n\n
          - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_TOPIC_NODE: </b> the maximum number of topic nodes in server.
          For e.g., in the topic /x/y/z, there are three nodes (/x, /y and z). \n\n
          - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_CL_ID_SIZE: </b> the maximum length of the client-id string. \n\n
          - <b> CFG_SR_MAX_NUM_CLIENT: </b> the maximum number of clients to be managed.
          Note this is different from the maximum number of 'contexts'. A large number
          of clients can be managed using fewer number of 'contexts' (connections). \n\n

          \note An app that has chosen not to await an ACK from the client for a
          scheduled transaction can benefit from the availability of control to
          pursue other activities to make overall progress in the system. However,
          an attempt to schedule another transaction with the client, while the
          previous one is still active, will cause the application to block. The
          app will unblock, once the previous transaction is completed.

            * \note The user applications implement the callbacks that are registered 
                    with the libraries. While using the MQTT library, invoking the 
                    core library APIs from a callback should be avoided and 
                    can lead to lockup scenarios. It is recommended to signal another 
                    task from the callback routines invoked from the library 
                    and invoke the core library API calls from that task.
