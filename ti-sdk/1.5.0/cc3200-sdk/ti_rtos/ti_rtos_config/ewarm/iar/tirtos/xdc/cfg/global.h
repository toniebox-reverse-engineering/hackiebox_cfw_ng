/*
 *  ======== global.h ========
 *  This header is used by C/C++ sources that want to "portably" include a
 *  configuration-specific generated header (which contains extern
 *  declarations of configuration specified global variables).
 *
 *  To use this header you must define the symbol xdc_cfg__header__ to be
 *  the package-qualified name of the configuration header.
 *
 *  For example, to compile sources that reference config values
 *  for a TI C6x target with a generated
 *  configuration header named "package/cfg/mycfg_p62.h" in a package
 *  named "local.examples" the following command line is sufficient:
 *
 *      cl6x -Dxdc_cfg__header__=local/examples/package/cfg/mycfg_p62.h ...
